This folder contains two files which implement the same functionality in different ways:
- one using a javascript closure
- the other using javascript class

Earlier versions of the javascript language did not support the concept of classes, but the unique behavior of the language which can contain functions inside of other functions allowed the concept of closures.

The example in this folder helps to understand how javascript closures are similar to classes.
